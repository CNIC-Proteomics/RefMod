# RefMod
 RefMod is an implementation of the ReCom concept (Laguillo-Gómez et al., 2023) designed to be run as a post-processing step after an open MSFragger search. It is compatible with both DDA and DIA data. When using RefMod, DIA data can be searched in a “pseudo-DDA” workflow, using a curated list of theoretical Δmass values to correct errors caused by the uncertainty in precursor masses contained within the same fragmentation window.
 RefMod has been developed at the Cardiovascular Proteomics Lab / Proteomics Unit at CNIC (Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research).
